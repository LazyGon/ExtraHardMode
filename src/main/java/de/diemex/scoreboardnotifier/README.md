# ScoreBoard Notifier

by Diemex

Ever wanted to show messages without spamming the chat? This adds per player scoreboards
that can be used to send messages to a player without spamming the chat. It supports auto removal of
messages, handling of similar message contents, splitting of text so it fits the 16 char limit and it
will add a suffix showing the count of a msg if it is being shown multiple times.
Scoreboards from other plugins will be restored once there are no messages to be displayed anymore.

## Usage

Copy these classes into your project (maven)
This package will be a separate project once it is stable and everything works perfectly.

Create a new ScoreboardManager

```java
NotificationManager man = NotificationManager(plugin);
```

Send your messages via

```java
man.showTimedPopup("Notch", 400, "Messages", "You rock!");
```
